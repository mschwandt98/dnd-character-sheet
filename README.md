# Digital DnD Character Sheet

All used DnD SVGs are not mine. I found the SVGs on reddit: Link to the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/itimlk/official_character_sheet_assets/).

When I started the project, I was a beginner in DnD myself. The development of the digital Character Sheet helped me to understand the game better.

If you notice any errors, please create an issue. Thank you!
